# Formalization of "Analysis I" by Terence Tao

The goal of this project is to formalize the book ["Analysis I"](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/) by Terence Tao, including the main text and the exercises. This is a work in progress. The formalization is done in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) using the [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) library (currently version 4).

We acknowledge the use of AI tools to assist in the formalization process, notably GitHub Copilot.
